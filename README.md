# QtQuick QMLTests Sandbox Starter Code
A set of codes to get up and running with the Qt6 QML. The code is the same starter code that this presenter (https://resources.qt.io/videos/qt-quick-3d-an-introduction-and-best-practices-2) used but the code was not shared publicly.

Running the code in QtCreator gives the following output.

I have also added a drawer panel on the right side with the sliders as in the original tutorial. Hopefully, this should help others in saving a lot of frustration that I went through with it. You can then follow along the excellent QtQuick QML tutorial easily with this starter code.
